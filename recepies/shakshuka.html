    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4-6 large eggs</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Crumbled feta cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or cast-iron pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion and red bell pepper. Saut√© until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and chili powder. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juices. Season generously with salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 10-15 minutes until it thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, create small wells in the sauce for the eggs.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the wells, spacing them evenly around the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 5-7 minutes. Adjust the cooking time based on your preference for egg doneness.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, sprinkle chopped parsley or cilantro over the top.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, directly from the skillet, with crusty bread for dipping. Optionally, sprinkle crumbled feta cheese on top for added richness and flavor.</li>
