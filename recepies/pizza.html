        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Olives</li>
        <li>Cooked sausage or ground beef</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Stir until a dough forms. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Make the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes until slightly thickened. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Assemble and Bake:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and, if available, place a pizza stone in the oven to heat up. Alternatively, prepare a baking sheet by lightly greasing it or lining it with parchment paper. Ensuring the oven and baking surface are properly heated will help achieve a crispy crust for your pizza.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into portions and roll out each portion into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a prepared pizza peel or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread sauce over the dough, leaving a small border. Add toppings as desired.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer pizza to the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes until crust is golden brown and toppings are bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven, let cool slightly, slice, and serve hot.</li>
    </ul>
